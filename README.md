## SMIBHID
[SMIBHID](smibhid/README.md) is the So Make It Bot Human Interface Device and definitely not a mispronunciation of any insults from a popular 90s documentary detailing the activites of the Jupiter Mining Core.

This device run on a Raspberry Pi Pico W and provides physical input and output to humans for the SMIB project; Buttons, LEDs, that sort of thing.

Further documentation can be found [in the smibhid folder](smibhid/README.md).
